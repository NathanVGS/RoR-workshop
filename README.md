# Get Rolling on (Ruby on) Rails

- Type of Challenge: `Learner Workshop`
- Duration: `3 hours`

## Learning objectives
- Install Ruby, Rails
- Setup your first project
- Learn the basics of Ruby on Rails through building a simple weblog
  - Learn your way around the file structure
  - Learn to use the MVC layer of Ruby on Rails
  - Learn to use the routing component
  - Learn about RubyGems
  - Learn about HTTP handling
  

## The Mission
In this workshop, I would like to guide you through the first steps of learning Ruby on Rails by building a weblog together. You will run into some familiar concepts like the MVC model, HTTP requests, routing and templates, and will also work with a virtual database that will store all the information you are adding to your web server. 

For Lamarr, all of this should remind you very much of Symfony. For Giertz, I will try to help you as much as I can where needed, but will always try to supply enough documentation for you to find your way as well.

### Step 1: Install Ruby and Rails

#### Installing Ruby

It's always worth checking if your computer came with Ruby preinstalled, or maybe you at some point installed it and never touched it again. You can do so by typing the following, usual code in your terminal: 

```
ruby -v
```

If this returns a message similar to:

```
ruby 2.6.3p62 (2019-04-16 revision 67580) [x86_64-linux]
```
... Then you're set! Otherwise, you can follow this link for the different installation methods depending on your operating system:
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/

For us Linux/Ubuntu users, i'll include the very simple terminal command you will need:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ruby-full
```
